## Current time ops



Position the current-time indicator by
* Directly dragging the current-time indicator (shift-drag snaps to markers or edge of closest clip)
* Clicking the timeline ruler to position the current-time indicator
* Typing a time value

## Clips

### Clip selection

Click the target clip  in the timeline – also selects linked clips

Alt-click – to select just the video or audio, or one clip in a group

Shift click / shift drag to extend selection

Alt - Also works for moving (dragging a clip)

### Moving

Drag clip to timeline – shifts all other clips down

Alt drag – only shifts target and linked tracks (e.g. doesn’t change background)

Drag to blank space above timeline to create new video / audio track

Drag to monitor panel – e.g. to create picture-in-picture (plus many other options)

### Cutting

Cut a video track – zaps and shifts all other tracks leftward.

Delete a video track – zaps and doesn’t shift other tracks

### Replacement

Replace clip – select in assets manager and then right click the target in the timeline


## Other useful things

Timeline -> Snap to enable / disable snapping to beginning or end.

Clip->Reveal in project – to show the source asset of a clip in the timeline
