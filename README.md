# Notes for Premiere elements

Taken from https://helpx.adobe.com/pdf/premiere-elements_reference.pdf

All of these notes are for the Expert view.

## Timeline

Clips in Higher tracks (e.g. Video 2) overlay clips in lower tracks

### Current time

Position the current-time indicator by
* Directly dragging the current-time indicator (shift-drag snaps to markers or edge of closest clip)
* Clicking the timeline ruler
* Typing a time value

## Clips

### Selecting a clip

`Click` the target clip in the timeline. Automatically selects linked clips (e.g. the audio associated with a video clip)

`Alt-click` – only selects the target (i.e., not any linked audio/video)

`Shift click` / `shift drag` to add more clips to a selection

`Alt` - Also works for moving (dragging a clip)

### Inserting clips

`Timeline->Snap` to toggle clip snapping

`Drag` clip to timeline to insert it. The new clip will split an existing clip if it is dropped into the midde of it. All other clips will shift to the right
'Alt-drag' - as above, but only linked clips will be split or moved. Use to add a new clip without splitting the background soundtrack, for example.

`Drag` clip to blank space above uppermost track in the timeline to create a track for the clip

`Drag` clip to monitor panel – to access options such as create picture-in-picture

### Cutting

Removing a selected clip. Lots of options. What happens depends on whether the target is selected (video AND audio, i.e. linked clips) or `Alt`-selected (i.e. just video OR audio).

* `Edit->Cut` / `Ctrl-X`: Deletes clip. If linked clips aren't selected, the gap doesn't close (i.e. audio is left in place)
* `Edit->Delete` / `Shift+Delete`: Deletes clip and doesn't close gap (linked or not)
* `Edit-Delete and close gap` / `Backspace`: Same as Cut? The gap doesn't close if linked clips aren't selected. 

### Replacement

Replace clip – select in assets manager and then right click the target in the timeline


## Other useful things

`Timeline->Snap` to enable / disable snapping of clips to each other

`Clip->Reveal` in project – to show the source asset of a clip in the timeline
